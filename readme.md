Pharmacy System (in Spanish) / NOT FINISHED, but
#### .........the emotion is on the road, not on the arrival ................ ####
===================

- - - - 
# Uses #

* C#
* EntityFramework
* SQL Server

It is a pharmacy system that aims to calculate the price of products according to drug prices. It is known that a product will consist of many drugs and different percentages of each.
In turn, the products can be pills, injectables, etc.
The database is not created with an ORM, so you will have to create a hand according to the attributes of the objects.

I developed it in Linux environment, with MySQL ODBC for Linux

I hope it helps!
