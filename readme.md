# Pharmacy System

Project that aims to facilitate the prices of medicines manufactured in the pharmacy.



### Objetivos 📦

It is a pharmacy system that aims to calculate the price of products according to drug prices. It is known that a product will consist of many drugs and different percentages of each.
In turn, the products can be pills, injectables, etc.


### Pre-requisitos 📋

* Desire
* Perseverance
* Windows/Mac
* [V](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/)isual Studio - 2019/2017 - i used 2019
* [S](https://www.microsoft.com/es-es/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)QL Server - i used 2014


### Installation 🔧

Once we have Visual and SQL installed, we will proceed to download the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/maximainero/sistema-farmacia-c.git
```

Then, we open Visual Studio and we must download EntityFramework. When I create the project, I use the ORM to create the classes, that is, I first create the model in the database and then link it to the project in the VS. In this case it is necessary to do the opposite because the classes are already created.


### Thanks 🎁

It is very complete, take advantage of it!

I hope it helps!
